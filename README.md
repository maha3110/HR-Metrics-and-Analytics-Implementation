# HR Analytics and Reporting BI Project
## Overview
Welcome to the HR Analytics and Reporting BI Project! This project is designed to provide HR professionals and management with powerful tools for analyzing HR data, generating reports, and gaining valuable insights into workforce management. The project integrates SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for data extraction and transformation, SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for data warehousing and multidimensional modeling, SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for report generation, and Power BI for interactive data visualization.

## Key Features
**Data Extraction and Transformation (SSIS):** Utilize SSIS packages to extract HR data from various sources, transform it into a structured format, and load it into the data warehouse.

**Data Warehousing (SSAS):** Create a multidimensional data model using SSAS to efficiently store and organize HR data, allowing for multidimensional analysis.

**Interactive Data Visualization (Power BI):** Create interactive and visually appealing HR dashboards and reports using Power BI.
